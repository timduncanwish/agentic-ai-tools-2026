## What is Agentic AI?

Agentic AI represents the next evolution of artificial intelligence - systems that can autonomously plan, execute, and achieve complex goals without constant human intervention. Unlike traditional chatbots that simply respond to prompts, agentic AI systems can:

- **Autonomously plan** multi-step workflows
- **Make decisions** based on real-time data
- **Use tools** to complete tasks (web search, code execution, API calls)
- **Learn from experience** and improve over time
- **Collaborate** with other AI agents to solve problems

In 2026, agentic AI has moved from experimental technology to production-ready systems that businesses are deploying at scale.
