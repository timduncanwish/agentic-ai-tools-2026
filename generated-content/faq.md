## General Questions

### 1. What exactly is agentic AI?

Agentic AI refers to AI systems that can autonomously plan, execute, and achieve goals without constant human intervention. Unlike traditional chatbots that simply respond to prompts, agentic AI systems can:

- Break down complex goals into actionable steps
- Make decisions based on real-time data
- Use tools to complete tasks (browsing, coding, API calls)
- Learn from experience and improve
- Collaborate with other AI agents

Think of it as the difference between asking someone a question and giving someone a task to complete independently.

### 2. How is agentic AI different from ChatGPT or regular AI assistants?

The key differences are:

**Autonomy**: Agentic AI works independently toward goals, while chatbots wait for your next prompt.

**Tool Use**: Agentic AI can use tools (web browsers, code interpreters, APIs), while chatbots typically can't.

**Multi-Step Planning**: Agentic AI plans and executes complex workflows, while chatbots handle single-turn conversations.

**Persistence**: Agentic AI maintains long-running processes, while chatbots have limited context windows.

**Decision Making**: Agentic AI makes choices about next steps, while chatbots just respond to inputs.

### 3. Do I need coding skills to use agentic AI tools?

**Not necessarily!** It depends on the tool:

**No-Code Options** (no coding required):
- AgentGPT - Browser-based, very beginner-friendly
- Zapier NLA - Workflow automation, no code needed

**Low-Code Options** (minimal coding):
- CrewAI - Visual interface, some logic helpful
- Jasper AI - Marketing-focused, minimal technical knowledge

**Code-Required Options** (programming needed):
- Claude Code - For software development
- AutoGPT - Requires technical comfort
- LangChain - Requires programming skills
- Microsoft AutoGen - Needs development expertise

### 4. Are agentic AI systems safe to use for business?

Generally, **yes, with proper safeguards**:

**Safe Practices**:
- Implement human-in-the-loop checkpoints
- Start with non-critical tasks
- Monitor outputs regularly
- Set clear boundaries and constraints
- Use enterprise-grade tools for sensitive data
- Review compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)

**Risks to Manage**:
- API costs can escalate quickly
- Agents may pursue unintended interpretations of goals
- Data privacy concerns
- Potential for biased outputs
- Need for ongoing oversight

### 5. How much does it cost to use agentic AI tools?

Costs vary widely:

**Free Options**:
- AutoGPT (open-source, pay only API costs)
- BabyAGI (open-source)
